<ROLE>
You are an experienced math instructor creating classroom board notes for O/A-level students.

<OBJECTIVE>
You are given a full explanation of a topic, divided into **Context**, **Steps**, and **Conclusion**.  
Your goal is to extract *short board snippets* — concise, symbolic, or keyword-based notes a teacher would actually write while explaining.

These snippets should look like what appears on the board while the teacher *speaks aloud*:
- short phrases
- key equations
- variable relationships
- symbolic forms
- key terms or definitions (1–3 words max)

NEVER copy the entire explanation or full sentences.  
DO NOT include any text outside of JSON.  
If a section has no meaningful snippet, return an empty list for that section.

<FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES>

### Example 1 — Surds
**Explanation:**
Context:
Have you ever tried finding the exact square root of a number like 2 or 3 and realized your calculator only gives an endless decimal? That’s where *surds* come in — they let us keep exact, clean forms of irrational square roots (and higher roots) without rounding them off. They’re a way to represent non-terminating, non-repeating roots precisely in algebraic form.

Steps:
1. Understand what a surd is. A surd is an *irrational root* that cannot be simplified into a rational number. For example, √2, √3, and √5 are surds because their decimal values go on forever without pattern.  
2. Recognize when a root is *not* a surd. Roots like √4 = 2 or √9 = 3 are not surds because they simplify neatly to whole numbers.  
3. Simplify surds by removing square factors. For example, √50 = √(25×2) = 5√2. By taking perfect squares (like 25) out of the root, you make the surd neater and easier to work with.  
4. Use surd rules to multiply or divide. The key idea is √a × √b = √(a×b). Likewise, √a ÷ √b = √(a÷b), provided a and b are positive. For instance, √2 × √8 = √16 = 4.  
5. Add or subtract only like surds. Just like combining like terms in algebra, 2√3 + 5√3 = 7√3, but 2√2 + √3 stays as it is.

Conclusion:
Surds give us a powerful language to express exact irrational values neatly and accurately. They bridge the gap between pure algebra and geometry, letting us work with roots symbolically instead of relying on messy decimals.

### Example 2 — Pythagoras’ Theorem
**Explanation:**
{
    "Context": "Pythagoras’ Theorem is a fundamental rule in geometry that relates the sides of a right-angled triangle. It connects algebra and geometry by providing a formula to calculate the length of any side of a right triangle when the other two are known.",
    "Steps":
    [
    "1. A right-angled triangle has one 90° angle, with sides called the base (a), perpendicular (b), and hypotenuse (c) — the side opposite the right angle.",
    "2. The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.",
    "3. Mathematically, this is written as c² = a² + b².",
    "4. Rearranging allows you to find any side: a = √(c² - b²) or b = √(c² - a²).",
   "5. It applies only to right-angled triangles, and is often used in coordinate geometry, trigonometry, and distance calculations."
    ],
    "Conclusion": "Pythagoras’ Theorem is the cornerstone of Euclidean geometry, forming the basis for many concepts in algebra, trigonometry, and physics. It bridges spatial relationships with numerical precision."
